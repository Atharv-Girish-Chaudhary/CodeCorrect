# CodeCorrect

> **CS 5800: Algorithms — Spring 2026 — Northeastern University**  
> Instructor: Dr. Lama Hamandi

A Python-based spell-checker for programmer typos — built on edit distance (Levenshtein distance) and dynamic programming.

---

## The Problem

Every programmer has been bitten by a typo: `pritn` instead of `print`, `lenght` instead of `length`, `retrun` instead of `return`. Unlike natural language, code typos don't just look wrong — they crash your program. Most IDEs underline errors but don't suggest corrections for arbitrary identifiers.

**Our question:** Given a mistyped token, how can we use edit distance to instantly suggest the closest valid match from a known vocabulary — and how does the choice of DP strategy affect real-time performance?

Motivated by **CLRS 3rd Edition, Chapter 15 (Dynamic Programming)** and **Problem 15-5** (edit distance with twiddle/transposition operations).

## Algorithms

All three implementations solve the same problem: compute the minimum number of single-character edits (insert, delete, replace) to transform string `s1` into string `s2`.

### 1. Naive Recursion — `src/naive.py`

Pure recursive solution. Recomputes overlapping subproblems repeatedly — exponential blowup.

```
edit_distance(s1, s2):
  if s1 is empty: return len(s2)
  if s2 is empty: return len(s1)
  if s1[-1] == s2[-1]: return edit_distance(s1[:-1], s2[:-1])
  return 1 + min(
    edit_distance(s1[:-1], s2),      # delete
    edit_distance(s1, s2[:-1]),      # insert
    edit_distance(s1[:-1], s2[:-1]) # replace
  )
```

| | Complexity |
|---|---|
| Time | O(3^(m+n)) |
| Space | O(m+n) — recursion stack |

### 2. Top-Down Memoization — `src/memoized.py`

Same recurrence as naive, but caches results in a `memo` dict so each `(i, j)` subproblem is solved exactly once.

| | Complexity |
|---|---|
| Time | O(m × n) |
| Space | O(m × n) memo table + O(m+n) stack |

### 3. Bottom-Up Tabulation — `src/tabulation.py`

Iteratively fills an `(m+1) × (n+1)` DP table. No recursion overhead. Includes a space-optimized rolling two-row variant.

| | Complexity |
|---|---|
| Time | O(m × n) |
| Space | O(m × n) full table, O(min(m,n)) space-optimized |

## CLRS Connections

| Topic | Connection |
|---|---|
| **Dynamic Programming (Ch. 15)** | Edit distance exhibits optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems — the two hallmarks of DP |
| **CLRS Problem 15-5** | The "twiddle" (transposition) operation models `pritn → print`, the dominant typo class in code |
| **Growth of Functions (Ch. 3)** | We prove O(3^(m+n)) for naive vs. O(mn) for DP and validate empirically with timing benchmarks |
| **Sorting (Ch. 2, 8)** | Candidates are sorted by edit distance to extract top-k suggestions efficiently |

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Atharv-Girish-Chaudhary/CodeCorrect.git
cd CodeCorrect
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

### CLI spell-checker

```bash
python src/spell_checker.py --word pritn --vocab data/python_keywords.txt --method tabulation --top 3
```

**Output:**

```
Top 3 suggestions for 'pritn':
  1. print    (distance: 2)
  2. int      (distance: 3)
  3. in       (distance: 4)
```

### Run implementations directly

```bash
python src/naive.py
python src/memoized.py
python src/tabulation.py
```

---

## Testing

```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Individual
pytest tests/test_tabulation.py -v
pytest tests/test_naive_memoized.py -v
```

**Current results:**

- `test_tabulation.py` — 27 passed
- `test_naive_memoized.py` — 63 passed

---

## Benchmarking

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark.py
```

Benchmarks all three strategies across vocabularies of increasing size (100 → 50K words):

| Vocab Size | Naive | Memoized | Tabulated |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | — | — | — |
| 1,000 | — | — | — |
| 10,000 | — | — | — |
| 50,000 | — | — | — |

*(Results to be filled in — Week 4)*
